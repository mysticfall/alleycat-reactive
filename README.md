# AlleyCat - Reactive

A part of the AlleyCat project which supports the _Reactive Object Pattern_.

## Introduction

AlleyCat Reactive is a project to explore the possibility of bridging the gap between the 
two most widely used programming paradigms, namely, the object-oriented programming (OOP), 
and functional programming (FP).

It aims to achieve its goal by proposing a new design pattern based on the 
[Reactive Extensions (Rx)](http://reactivex.io/). At the moment, the project is at a proof-of-concept 
stage, so it lacks useful documentation, and it has not been published to a public repository yet.

I did not bother to write extensively about the proposed pattern at this stage because it may 
very well turn out to be an impractical, or useless idea. I made this library to use it in a 
game-related project, so I will add code examples and explain the principle in details once 
the library proves its viability in a more practical environment than a few simple test cases.
